## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value                  | Type   | Description                                             | Default |

| `startSort` (Optional) | Number | The index (zero indexed) of the column to sort on load. | No sort |

## Side Effects

## How to Use

This is a fire-and-forget controller, there are no actions, targets or events to worry about. Just install it on your table and forget about it.

The controller expects a well-formed table, including a `<thead>` with one row of header cells, and `<tbody>` with all of your table data.

Once the controller is installed, users can sort table data by clicking on `<th>` cells in the table's header.
If you want to mark a column as unsortable, add `data-sortable="false"` to the `<th>` element for that column.

If you want to sort a column by some other value than its text content, add `data-sort-value="something-else"` to each cell in that column.
i.e.
```html
<tr>
    <td>Sally</td>
    <td>21</td>
    <td>sally@example.com</td>
    <td data-sort-value="2021-01-19">January 19th, 2021</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Trevor</td>
    <td>45</td>
    <td>trevor@example.com</td>
    <td data-sort-value="2020-02-18">February 18th, 2020</td>
</tr>
```

If `startSortValue` is set, the table will be sorted on load, otherwise the table will stay as it loaded until a user clicks on a column heading.

You can also set `data-sort-bottom` and `data-sort-top` attributes on `<tr>`s to pin a row to the top or bottom of the table, i.e.
```html
<tr data-sort-top="true">
    <td colspan="4">
This row is always at the top
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sally</td>
    <td>21</td>
    <td>sally@example.com</td>
    <td>January 19th, 2021</td>
</tr>
<tr data-sort-bottom="true">
    <td colspan="4">
This row is always at the bottom
    </td>
</tr>
```

# Notes & Limitations
- This controller cannot sort tables with inconsistent colspans. If your table has `<th>` and `<td>` with the same colspans, everything should work as expected, everything else is undefined.
- This controller also cannot sort tables with rowspans.
- When the table is sorted, rows are removed from the DOM and re-inserted into their new position - any custom properties or installed event listeners on the `<tr>` and `<td>` elements may be lost.
