## Purpose

This controller will equalize the heights of all `watchTargets` that are connected to the controller so that they are all the same height.

*Note:* For the majority of use-cases, Flexbox is a better solution than this controller, but this can be used as a
fallback in contexts where third-party libraries mean that flexbox doesn't work or your CSS system doesn't support flexbox.
