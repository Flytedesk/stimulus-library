## Purpose

Auto submits a form when and of its input's values change - i.e. autosave.

## Use Cases
- An application where you have inline-editing. I.e. clicking on a name in your profile changes it to an input field to edit it. Can be used to submit the form when the user finishes editing the field, without needing a button press.
- Auto submitting a form to update page filters when a user changes a filter, or ticks a new category.

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` (Optional) | String | The mode to submit the form using, either `direct` or `request`. <br/><br/>`direct` calls `.submit()` on the form without dispatching the `submit` event. <br/>`request` synthesizes a normal `submit` event on the form, a submit event will still be fired and any listeners that modify the behaviours of the form will still run.<br/><br/>  | `request` |


## Events


<NoEvents/>

## Side Effects

- Adds event listeners for `change` to all `<input>` `<textarea>` and `<select>` elements in the controller's scope
- If the `modeValue` is `request` and the browser does not support `.requestSubmit()`, then the controller will use any existing submit buttons, or create a hidden submit button (which will be cleaned up on 'disconnect'), to submit the form by clicking on them.
