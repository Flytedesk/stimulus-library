## Purpose

A Stimulus controller to deal with Rails UJS remote forms and their submission responses.

Acts like [LoadBlockController](./LoadBlockController) in that it will receive an HTML partial in response to a UJS remote-form submission that it can hot-swap into the DOM, but using UJS as a vehicle instead of a GET fetch request.


## [Actions](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/actions)

| `replace` | Replace the attached form with the contents of the response. Needs to be wired up to the UJS `ajax:success` and/or `ajax:error` events. |
